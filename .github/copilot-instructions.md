# GitHub Copilot Instructions for eva-seed

This repo is part of the EVA 2.0 workspace managed by **eva-orchestrator**.

## 🔗 Primary Context

When working in this repository, always treat **eva-orchestrator** as the control plane:

1. First, read (or assume as loaded) the orchestrator Copilot instructions in:
   `../eva-orchestrator/.github/copilot-instructions.md`
2. Apply the same Agile operating model, roles, and guardrails here.
3. Use existing conventions from:
   - `README.md`
   - `docs/`
   - `scripts/`
   - `src/` (or other app folders)

## ✅ Execution Evidence Rule

For every script, command, or workflow you generate in this repo, you MUST:

1. Explain **exactly how to run it safely**
   - Which directory to run from
   - Any required environment variables, tools, or pre-steps
2. Describe **what successful execution looks like**
   - Sample console output, logs, created files, or visible UI changes
3. Clearly flag anything that has **not actually been executed** as:
   `NOT EXECUTED – REVIEW CAREFULLY`

> Never hand Marco code or commands without an explicit test/validation plan and expected results.

## 🧩 Working Style

- Prefer **small, testable changes** over large refactors.
- Keep answers **concise and structured** (headings, bullets, code blocks).
- When in doubt, **ask for clarification**, don't assume.
- Document non-trivial decisions in `docs/` (or the place indicated by README).
